I implmented the following algorithms:

-> Algorithm for Getting Hardware and Software Information

-> CPU - String - Lower Case To Upper Case Transformation Algorithm
-> CPU - String - Vowel Elimination Algorithm
-> CPU - String - Text Splitting Into Words Algorithm
-> CPU - String - Data Encryption/Decryption Algorithm

-> GPU - Particle System Generation Algorithm

-> Memory - Allocation using malloc()
-> Memory - Allocation using calloc()
-> Memory - Allocation using realloc()
-> Memory - Allocation using a custom memory pool




-> Main Controller
-> Benchmark Progress Controller
-> Log File Controller

-> Main View
-> Benchmark Progress View (does not work as intended)
-> Log File View
